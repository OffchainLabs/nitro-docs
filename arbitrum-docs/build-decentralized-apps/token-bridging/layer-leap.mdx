## Single click bridging from L1 to L3 is now possible with layer leap

- [ Main repository ](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/l1-l3-teleport-contracts) 
- [ SDK support ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arbitrum/sdk/v/3.5.1-teleporter.0) (pre-release!)
- [ Request Feature ](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-token-bridge/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feat,triage&projects=&template=add-layerleap-request.yml&title=[feat])

## Launch details

_Key timelines & announcements_

**Orbit Onboarding:** Orbit L3 chains that use ETH for their gas token are eligible for immediate onboarding, while Orbit L3 chains that use custom gas tokens will be supported in future releases. Orbit L3s interested in adopting Layer Leap, regardless of the token they use for gas, should reach out regardless <INSERT THE CONTACT METHOD HERE>. 

_Upcoming launches & future releases_

A future release of Layer Leap is not yet scheduled, but upcoming features including providing support for Orbit L3s with custom gas tokens.

## Value & user impact

**End-users:** Can now bridge `ETH` and `ERC-20`s from Ethereum to your Orbit L3 in a single click.

- Bridging `ETH` requires one call on L1
- Bridging an `ERC-20` requires one approval and one call on L1

**Orbit L3s:** Can more seamlessly onboard `ETH` and `ERC-20`s from Ethereum mainnet.

_Which Orbit configurations can adopt this feature?_

**Any L3 Orbit Chains on top of an Arbitrum chain** **_with ETH gas fees_** can use Layer Leap.

- Layer Leap contracts are currently only deployed for Arb One and Arb Nova, but contracts can be deployed for additional Arbitrum Layer-2s by Offchain Labs or your RaaS provider.
  - The Layer 2 must be an Arbitrum chain due to the use of retryables.
- _Future support: Layer Leap will support Orbit chains with custom gas tokens in a future release_

## Implementation

_How can Orbit chains adopt this feature?_

**UI Adoption:** Layer leap contracts can be integrated into your own bridge or added to your chain’s UI for the Arbitrum bridge (bridge.arbitrum.io)

### Arbitrum bridge UI: if you are already on the arbitrum bridge UI then you can sign up for layer leap adoption by using this [github template](https://github.com/offchainlabs/arbitrum-token-bridge/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feat%2ctriage&projects=&template=add-layerleap-request.yml&title=%5bfeat%5d%3a+enable+layer+leap+for+%3corbit+chain%3e).

    - If you are not on the Arbitrum Bridge UI yet you can sign up by filling out this [GitHub Template](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-token-bridge/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feat%2Ctriage&projects=&template=add-orbit-chain-request.yml&title=%5Bfeat%5D%3A+), and then also fill out the template above.
    - You can demo Layer Leap on the Arbitrum Bridge by bridging to [Rari](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?destinationChain=rari-mainnet&sourceChain=ethereum) and [Proof of Play](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?destinationChain=pop-apex&sourceChain=ethereum).

### Custom bridge UI: if you want to integrate layer leap functionality into your custom bridge UI, read the [info page on the layer leap github](https://github.com/offchainlabs/l1-l3-teleport-contracts/blob/main/docs/info.md) to learn more.

_What chains are currently supported?_

Layer Leap requires an L1 teleporter contract for each L2 chain. `L1Teleporter` contracts are deployed on Ethereum L1 for Arb One and Arb Nova.

| Contract              | Address                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Arb One L1Teleporter  | https://etherscan.io/address/0xCBd9c6e310D6AaDeF9F025f716284162F0158992 |
| Arb Nova L1Teleporter | https://etherscan.io/address/0xCBd9c6e310D6AaDeF9F025f716284162F0158992 |

For non Arbitrum One L3s:

- To enable Layer Leap for your Layer 3 you can follow the Deployment Procedure defined [here](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/l1-l3-teleport-contracts/blob/main/docs/info.md). Before self deploying, let Offchain Labs know about your request!

_Implementation requirements for RaaSes?_

Sending tokens from L2 to L3 relies on creation of a retryable. If you are supporting Layer Leap for your Orbit chains it’s highly recommended to be running the Retryables Monitoring tool: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-retryables-monitoring. This will allow you to track and redeem any failed retryables

_What configuration options or parameter changes should I consider?_
